# Hi there, I'm Aatman Panseriya ðŸ‘‹

With 2.2 years of experience in backend engineering, I specialize in building scalable systems and automating complex workflows. Iâ€™m deeply interested in understanding the inner workings of technology, particularly distributed systems and microservices architecture. Always eager to learn, I explore emerging technologies to solve complex challenges.

I primarily work with Java, Spring Boot, and Microservices to build scalable applications. My expertise extends to cloud technologies, particularly AWS, along with tools like Docker, RabbitMQ, and Apache Kafka for system orchestration. I also have strong experience in PostgreSQL for database management and use Git for version contro

I'm currently learning System Design, Advanced Kafka, Cloud Architecture, Distributed Systems, Microservices, and Kubernetes to enhance my skills in building scalable systems
